The Student Record Management System is a Java-based command-line application designed to manage student data efficiently. This project provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to store and manipulate student records in memory using an ArrayList.

The system allows the user to:
Add Student – Store student details such as ID, Name, and Marks.
View Students – Display all student records in a formatted manner.
Update Student – Modify existing student details using the student ID.
Delete Student – Remove a student record from the system.
Exit Program – Close the application safely.

Key Features:
Built entirely in Java using Eclipse IDE.
OOP Principles applied with a Student class for data encapsulation.
Uses ArrayList for dynamic data storage.
Menu-driven interface for easy navigation.
Validates student IDs before updating or deleting records.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Java
IDE: Eclipse IDE
Core Java Concepts: Classes, Objects, Methods, Encapsulation, Collections Framework (ArrayList), Loops, Conditionals.

Possible Enhancements:
Adding file storage to save records permanently.
Integrating a database (MySQL) for large-scale storage.
Adding search and sorting functionalities.
Creating a GUI version using JavaFX or Swing.
